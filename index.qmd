### BIO

Hello! I'm Elaine Yi, a third-year undergraduate at the University of Toronto. Currently pursuing a double major in Mathematics and Actuarial Science, and a minor in Statistics.

Outside the world of numbers, you'll often find me going through snows on skis or capturing the moments through the lens of my camera. I love travelling and my top 3 destinations are Namibia, Norway and Egypt.

As I navigate my academics and interests, I'm excited about the journey ahead and the stories waiting to be written.

I have attached my resume in PDF format in the top right corner, next to 'Home'.
